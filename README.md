Live Application URL: https://smart-shopping-assistant-3af20.web.app/

Introduction
Talk2Shop is a modern, hands-free e-commerce web application designed for a seamless grocery shopping experience. The core feature of this project is its voice-powered assistant, which allows users to manage their shopping cart using natural language commands in both English and Hindi. This project was developed as a technical assessment, focusing on creating a high-quality, responsive, and intuitive user interface without reliance on external, rate-limited APIs for its core functionality.

Features
Voice-Powered Cart Management: Add items, specify quantities, and remove items from the cart using natural language commands.

Multilingual Support: The assistant understands commands in both English and Hindi.

Client-Side NLP: A fast and efficient custom NLP engine runs directly in the browser, providing instant responses without API latency or costs. It intelligently maps generic terms (e.g., "apple," "केले") to specific products in the store.

Smart Suggestions: After adding an item, the app suggests complementary products based on common shopping patterns (e.g., adding bread suggests butter).

Interactive Product Catalog: Browse a rich catalog of products organized by categories.

Dual Voice Search: Use your voice to search for products via the text input or to add items directly to the cart.

Fully Responsive UI: The interface is designed to provide a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Tech Stack

Core Logic: JavaScript (ES6+)
